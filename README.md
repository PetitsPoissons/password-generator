# Password Generator

This application can be used to generate a random password based on criteria selected by the user.
It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by JavaScript code.

The user is prompted for the length of the password (no less than 8 characters and no more than 128 characters). The user is also asked whether or not the password should include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
